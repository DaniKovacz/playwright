### TC_OR_004: Verify Search for Valid Order
**Module:** Orders & Returns - Order Lookup  
**Test Case ID:** TC_OR_004  
**Test Case Title:** Verify Search for Valid Order  
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)  
**Test Type:** Functional  
**Automation Status:** Automated  

**Test Objective:**  
To verify that customers can successfully search for their orders using valid order information.

**Prerequisites:**
- Application is accessible
- User is on the orders and returns page
- Test data is available for order lookup
- Order search functionality is enabled

**Test Data:**
- Order Number: "000000001"
- Billing Last Name: "Smith"
- Email: "test@example.com"

**Test Steps:**
| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to the orders and returns page | Page loads successfully |
| 2 | Enter order number "000000001" | Order number is entered correctly |
| 3 | Enter billing last name "Smith" | Last name is entered correctly |
| 4 | Enter email "test@example.com" | Email is entered correctly |
| 5 | Click submit button | Form submission is triggered |
| 6 | Apply browser-specific wait strategy | System processes request |
| 7 | Check for order found or not found message | Appropriate response is displayed |

**Browser-Specific Implementation:**
- **Firefox/WebKit:** DOM content loaded (10s timeout) + 2s buffer for stability
- **Chrome:** Network idle wait for consistency and performance

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ System processes the order search request successfully
- ✅ Either order details are displayed OR "order not found" message appears
- ✅ Both outcomes are acceptable depending on data availability
- ✅ System provides clear feedback to the customer

**Actual Results:** [To be filled during execution]

**Test Status:** [PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED]

**Remarks:** Critical for customer service and order tracking functionality
